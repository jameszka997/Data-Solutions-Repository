# 2025 Project List Exploration: Insight and Analysis

## 🎯 Overview
This project analyzed the 2025 audit project list to identify key patterns and characteristics for strategic planning. Using Excel pivot tables and visualizations, I explored geographic distribution, company types, priority categories, and special requirements across hundreds of European companies. This README demonstrates the analytical approach - actual data and results cannot be shared due to confidential company information.

### !!! Disclaimer
Due to the confidential nature of the audit data, specific company information and detailed results cannot be shared publicly. This README showcases the analytical methodology and approach used.

## 🏢 Business Problem

### Context
Received the first project list of 2025 for European company audits. No prior knowledge existed about list characteristics or patterns.

### Specific Challenges
- **Unknown Geographic Distribution:** No visibility into country-level company concentration
- **Unclear Company Composition:** Limited understanding of business types requiring audits
- **Priority Category Blindspots:** No data on company distribution across audit categories
- **Special Requirements Uncertainty:** Unknown companies requiring non-standard audit approaches
- **Resource Allocation Risk:** Potential inefficient team deployment without pattern understanding
- **Scheduling Inefficiencies:** Risk of suboptimal audit scheduling without geographic insights

## 💡 Solution Overview

### High-Level Approach
Comprehensive data exploration using Excel's analytical capabilities to transform raw company data into actionable intelligence.

### Key Solution Components
- Pivot table analysis for pattern identification
- Visualization creation for clear communication
- Geographic and categorical analysis
- Special requirements mapping
